**TANZANIA DRAUGHTS-64**

**OFFICIAL RULES**

*Version 2.2 - Publication Ready Edition*

*Including Online Governance & Engine Compliance Standards*

# PREAMBLE

These Official Rules govern all forms of Draughts-64 (Russian Checkers) played under Tanzania Draughts Federation authority. Throughout this document, 'Tanzania Draughts-64' is referred to as 'TZD' and the 'Tanzania Draughts Federation' is referred to as 'TZD Federation' or 'the Federation.'

**Scope of Application:**

TZD rules govern:

- Over-the-board (OTB) physical play

- Online digital play on TZD Federation-approved platforms

- Engine-assisted analysis and training

- Tournament competition at all levels

The rules are structured in three parts: Core Game Rules (Articles 1-11), Online Governance (Article 12), and Engine Compliance Standards (Article 13).

**PART I: CORE GAME RULES**

# 1. The Game and Players

- Draughts-64 is a strategic board game between two players.

- The participants are defined as players. In official competition, players must be registered with the TZD Federation or an affiliated organization.

- One player control white (light) pieces, the other controls black (dark) pieces.

# 2. The Material

## 2.1. The Board

- Draughts-64 is played on a square board divided into 64 equal squares, alternately light and dark.

- The game is played only on the dark squares. Thus, 32 squares are active.

- The diagonal lines formed by dark squares are called diagonals. The longest diagonal connecting opposite corners and comprising 8 squares is called the long diagonal (a1-h8 or h1-a8).

- The board must be positioned so the long diagonal starts at the left-hand side of each player. The first square at the left of each player must be a dark square.

- Board features:

- Bases: the side of the board facing each player (first and eighth ranks)

- Sides: the edge columns (a-file and h-file)

- Ranks: horizontal lines containing 4 dark squares each

- Files: vertical lines containing 4 dark squares each

## 2.2. The Pieces

- Each player begins with 12 pieces (men).

- Starting position: White's 12 men occupy the dark squares of ranks 1, 2, and 3. Black's 12 men occupy the dark squares of ranks 6, 7, and 8. Ranks 4 and 5 are empty.

- In algebraic notation, the starting position is: White: a1, c1, e1, g1, b2, d2, f2, h2, a3, c3, e3, g3. Black: b6, d6, f6, h6, a7, c7, e7, g7, b8, d8, f8, h8.

# 3. Movement of Pieces

- A piece may be either a man or a king.

- Men and kings have different movement and capturing abilities. The movement of one piece is called a move.

- White always moves first. Players alternate moves with their own pieces.

- Each move must be executed with one hand only.

## 3.1. Man Movement

- A man moves diagonally forward one square to an adjacent empty dark square.

- **Men can NEVER move backward - not for regular moves, not for captures, NEVER. Men move forward only.**

## 3.2. King Movement

- A king is a man that has reached the opponent's back rank (promotion).

- Upon promotion, the man is crowned with another piece of the same color to indicate its king status.

- Either player may crown the promoted piece. If the opponent does not crown it, the player must crown their own piece as part of the move. A crowned owned king remains a king. Playing with an uncrowned king constitutes an irregular move.

- A king moves diagonally forward or backward any number of empty squares along the diagonal it occupies (flying king).

## 3.3. Completion of Move

- A move is complete when the player releases the piece after placing it on its destination square.

- Touch-move rule: If a player whose turn it is touches a movable piece, that piece must be moved if a legal move exists.

- Before release, a piece may be placed on any legal destination square.

- A player wishing to adjust pieces without moving them must first clearly announce "I adjust" or "j'adoube."

# 4. Capturing

## 4.1. Capture Direction Rules (CRITICAL)

- **Men: Can ONLY capture in forward diagonal directions. Men can NEVER capture backward under ANY circumstances - not in single captures, not in multiple captures, not ever. Forward only means: White men capture toward rank 8, Black men capture toward rank 1.**

- **Kings: May capture both forward and backward along any diagonal.**

- A capture counts as one complete move. Players cannot capture their own pieces.

## 4.2. Man, Capture Procedure

- When a man encounters an opponent's piece on an adjacent forward diagonal square, with a free square immediately beyond, the man must jump over the opponent's piece and land on the free square. The opponent's piece is captured and removed.

- **CRITICAL: Men can NEVER capture backward. If during a capture sequence a backward capture opportunity appears, the man CANNOT take it. Men MUST only capture in forward diagonals. Any capture that would require backward movement is ILLEGAL for men.**

## 4.3. King Capture Procedure

- When a king encounters an opponent's piece anywhere along its diagonal, with one or more free squares beyond, the king must jump over the piece and land on any free square beyond it (player's choice).

## 4.4. Capture Execution

- Captures must be clearly indicated. The capturing piece must be placed down on each intermediate square during multiple captures.

- All capturing and piece removal must be done with one hand. Using two hands is irregular.

- Captured pieces remain on the board until the capture sequence is complete, then are removed in the order captured.

## 4.5. Multiple Captures by Men

- **If after capturing, a man encounters another opponent piece on a forward diagonal with a free square beyond, it MUST continue capturing. This continues until no more forward captures are possible.**

- Captured pieces are removed after the complete sequence, in capture order.

## 4.6. Multiple Captures by Kings

- When a king captures and can capture again (on the same or perpendicular diagonal), it must continue capturing. The king may change direction during the sequence.

- The king lands on any free square beyond the last captured piece on that diagonal.

## 4.7. Multiple Capture Restrictions

- During a multiple capture, jumping over your own pieces is forbidden.

- Passing over the same empty square multiple times is permitted.

- Jumping over the same opponent piece more than once is forbidden (Turkish strike rule).

## 4.8. Capture Completion

- A capture sequence is complete when the player releases the capturing piece.

- Piece removal is complete when all captured pieces are removed or the player clearly stops the removal process.

## 4.9. Capture Choice

- **Tanzania Draughts-64 uses FREE CHOICE capture: When multiple capture options exist, the player may choose any legal capture, regardless of quantity or quality of pieces captured.**

- Note: This differs from the Brazilian variant's maximum capture rule.

## 4.10. Promotion During Capture (CORRECTED)

- **CORRECTED RULE: If a man reaches the opponent's back rank during a capture sequence and additional captures are available, the capture ****sequence ENDS immediately. The man is promoted to king and stops on the back rank.**

- The newly promoted king may capture on the next turn if opportunities exist.

- If a man reaches the back rank WITHOUT capturing, it is promoted and stops. It may capture as a king on the next move.

# 5. Variant Rules (Reference Only)

*The Brazilian variant of Draughts-64 differs from Tanzania rules in two key ways:*

- *Maximum capture required (not used in Tanzania Draughts)*

- *Promotion mid-capture continues as man (not used in Tanzania Draughts)*

***These variant rules do NOT apply to official Tanzania Draughts Federation play.***

# 6. Irregularities

- If incorrect board orientation is discovered during a game, the game is annulled and replayed.

- Starting position compliance must be verified before starting. Irregularities noted during play may be rectified at opponent's discretion.

- If a player accidentally displaces pieces, they must restore the correct position on their own time. The referee may penalize the player.

- When a player commits an irregularity, the opponent may choose to either demand rectification or allow the irregular play to stand.

- Common irregularities include:

- Playing two moves consecutively

- Moving a piece illegally

- Touching one piece but moving another

- Taking back a completed move

- Moving opponent's piece

- Moving when capture is mandatory

- Capturing incorrect number of pieces

- Stopping mid-capture

- Removing pieces not jumped

- Using two hands for moves/captures

- Playing with uncrowned king

- Situations arising from circumstances beyond players' control are not considered irregularities.

- If the opponent makes a move after an irregularity, this constitutes acceptance. Rectification can no longer be claimed.

- Partial rectification is not permitted.

- The referee may penalize players who commit irregularities.

# 7. Game Result

A game ends in one of two ways:

• Win for one player (loss for the other)

• Draw (neither player wins)

## 7.1. Winning the Game

A player wins when the opponent:

- Resigns

- Has no legal moves (all pieces blocked)

- Has no pieces remaining

- Runs out of time (in timed games)

- Refuses to comply with official rules

## 7.2. Draw by Agreement

- Players may agree to a draw by mutual consent at any time.

- Draw offers should be made after completing your move and before opponent responds.

# 8. Draw Conditions (Simplified for Tanzania)

**Tanzania Draughts uses simplified draw rules for practical tournament implementation:**

## 8.1. Insufficient Material

- The game is a draw if neither player has sufficient material to force a win.

## 8.2. Threefold Repetition

- If the same position occurs three times with the same player to move, that player may claim a draw.

## 8.3. 30-Move Rule (Simplified)

- **If 30 consecutive moves occur (by both players) with only kings on the board and no captures, either player may claim a draw.**

## 8.4. King vs. King Endgames

- The following positions are automatic draws after 5 moves if no winning position is achieved:

- King vs. King

- King + Man vs. King

- Two Kings vs. King

## 8.5. Three Kings Rule

- If a player has three or more kings against one enemy king and cannot capture within 12 moves by the stronger side (counting from when the material imbalance was established), the game is a draw.

# 9. Algebraic Notation

- Draughts-64 uses standard algebraic notation.

- Files are labeled a-h (left to right from White's perspective). Ranks are numbered 1-8 (bottom to top from White's perspective).

- Each dark square is identified by its file letter and rank number (e.g., a1, c3, h8).

- Move notation:

- Simple move: starting square, hyphen, destination square (e.g., a3-b4)

- Capture: starting square, colon, landing square (e.g., a3:c5)

- Multiple capture: show each intermediate direction change (e.g., d2:f4:h6:f8)

- Annotation symbols:

- ! = good move, !! = excellent move

- ? = weak move, ?? = blunder

- !? = interesting move, ?! = dubious move

- + = winning position, = = drawn position

# 10. Time Control

- Games may be played with time controls. When time controls are used:

- A chess clock or digital timer is required

- Move recording is required

- Time control formats:

- Classical: 60+ minutes per player

- Rapid: 10-30 minutes per player (or 10-15 minutes + Fischer increment)

- Blitz: 3-5 minutes per player (or 3-5 minutes + Fischer increment)

- When a player's time expires, that player loses unless the opponent has insufficient material to win (as defined in Article 8.1), in which case the game is drawn.

# 11. Competition Regulations

- All TZD Federation-sanctioned tournaments must follow these official rules.

- Tournament directors have authority to make rulings on disputes and irregularities.

- Players must conduct themselves professionally. Unsporting behavior may result in warnings, penalties, or disqualification.

- Electronic devices (phones, tablets, etc.) are prohibited during play unless specifically authorized.

**PART II: ONLINE GOVERNANCE**

# 12. Online Play Standards

*These provisions govern digital/online play on TZD Federation-approved platforms.*

## 12.1. Server Authority

- **The game server is the authoritative referee for all online play. Server decisions are final.**

- The server validates all moves before execution. Illegal moves are automatically rejected.

- Game state is maintained by the server. Client displays are for visualization only.

## 12.2. Automatic Rule Enforcement

- The server automatically enforces:

- Legal move validation (piece movement rules)

- Mandatory captures (if capture available, non-capturing moves rejected)

- Automatic promotion on reaching back rank

- Turn order enforcement

- Time control enforcement

- Draw conditions (repetition, insufficient material)

## 12.3. Time Management

- Server clock is authoritative. Client clocks are advisory only.

- Time expires when server clock reaches zero. Automatic loss (or draw if opponent cannot win).

- Fischer increment (if used) is added by server after each move completion.

## 12.4. Disconnection Policy

- If a player disconnects:

- Their clock continues running

- They have a grace period (configurable, typically 60-120 seconds) to reconnect

- If time expires during disconnection, they lose

- Upon reconnection, game continues from current position

- Repeated disconnections may be treated as unsporting conduct.

## 12.5. Fair Play & Anti-Cheating

- **Use of engines, outside assistance, or multiple accounts during online play is strictly prohibited.**

- The TZD Federation may deploy anti-cheating detection systems including:

- Move pattern analysis

- Timing analysis

- Statistical comparison with engine play

- Violations result in:

- Game forfeiture

- Account suspension or ban

- Rating adjustment

- Tournament disqualification

## 12.6. Appeals & Disputes

- Technical errors: If a player believes a server error occurred, they must report it immediately via the platform's dispute mechanism.

- Appeals are reviewed by TZD Federation officials. Server logs are authoritative evidence.

- Fair play violations: Suspected cheating should be reported via official channels. The TZD Federation investigates and rules.

## 12.7. Platform Requirements

- TZD Federation-approved platforms must:

- Implement all TZD rules correctly

- Maintain secure game logs for at least 90 days

- Use algebraic notation for move recording

- Support standard time controls (Classical, Rapid, Blitz)

- Provide move validation feedback to players

- Allow game download in standard format (PGN-equivalent)

**PART III: ENGINE COMPLIANCE STANDARDS**

# 13. Engine Implementation Requirements

*These technical specifications ensure draughts engines correctly implement TZD rules.*

## 13.1. Board Representation

- Engines must support 8×8 board with algebraic notation (a1-h8).

- Dark squares only (32 active squares): a1, c1, e1, g1, b2, d2, f2, h2, a3, c3, e3, g3, b4, d4, f4, h4, a5, c5, e5, g5, b6, d6, f6, h6, a7, c7, e7, g7, b8, d8, f8, h8.

- Piece representation: White man (w), White king (W), Black man (b), Black king (B).

## 13.2. Move Generation Rules

- **CRITICAL: Men can NEVER move backward. Not for regular moves, not for captures, not in any situation. Forward only, always.**

- White men: move/capture ONLY toward rank 8 (increasing rank number)

- Black men: move/capture ONLY toward rank 1 (decreasing rank number)

- **Any backward movement by a man is illegal and must be rejected by the engine.**

- King moves: bidirectional (forward and backward) along diagonals.

- Flying kings: Kings may move/capture any distance along clear diagonals.

## 13.3. Capture Logic

- **Mandatory capture: If any capture is available, non-capturing moves are illegal.**

- **Free choice: Multiple capture options = player chooses (no maximum capture requirement).**

- Multiple captures:

- Continue capturing until no more captures available

- Cannot jump same piece twice (Turkish strike)

- May pass over same empty square multiple times

- Cannot jump own pieces

- **Promotion during capture: Capture sequence ENDS when man reaches back rank. Man promoted, cannot continue capturing that turn.**

## 13.4. Position Evaluation

- Engines should evaluate positions based on:

- Material: Suggested relative values are Man = 1.0 unit, King = 2.5-3.0 units (engine developers may refine these values based on testing)

- Position: Center control, piece mobility, king placement, back rank control

- Tactical factors: Forcing sequences, tempo advantages, piece coordination

- Endgame: Known theoretical outcomes and tablebase results

## 13.5. Draw Detection

- Engines must detect:

- Threefold repetition

- 30-move rule (kings only, no captures)

- Insufficient material (K vs K, K+man vs K, etc.)

- 15-move rule (3+ kings vs 1 king)

## 13.6. Protocol Support

- TZD-compliant engines should support:

- Standard input/output communication protocol

- Position setup via FEN-like notation or algebraic piece list

- Move output in algebraic notation (e.g., a3-b4, c3:e5:g7)

- Time control management

- Search depth or time limits

## 13.7. Testing & Certification

- Engines seeking TZD Federation certification must pass:

- Move legality test suite (100+ positions)

- Mandatory capture enforcement test

- Promotion rules test

- Multiple capture test (including direction restrictions for men)

- Draw condition test

- Test suites are available from the TZD Federation upon request.

## 13.8. Critical Implementation Notes

- **Forward direction definition:**

- White forward = increasing rank number (toward rank 8)

- Black forward = decreasing rank number (toward rank 1)

- **Common implementation errors to avoid:**

- **Allowing men to move backward (MOST CRITICAL ERROR - men can NEVER move backward for any reason)**

- **Allowing men to capture backward (men can ONLY capture forward)**

- Requiring maximum capture (Brazilian variant—not used here)

- Allowing promotion mid-capture to continue as king (should stop)

- Incorrect draw rule implementation (overly complex FMJD rules)
